**`Digital Craftsman (Developer/Photographer/Content Creator)`**

I'm Manuel, but you might know me online as "Card". I'm a budding full-stack developer based in Germany, having embarked on this coding journey a little under a year ago.
Despite my relatively short time in the field, I have developed a profound passion for it. I am constantly pushing myself to learn more and enhance my skills, which range from front-end to back-end development.

Outside of coding, I have a passion for photography and content creation. I often find similarities between the two fields, both requiring a keen eye for detail and a deep understanding of complex systems.

Whether it's through lines of code or a camera lens, I'm always looking to create and learn. Feel free to explore my projects and get in touch if you have any questions or collaborations in mind.

  <summary><h3> üìï My coding journey <h3></summary>
When the COVID-19 pandemic hit and photography work dried up, I found myself seeking a new challenge. That's when I stumbled upon coding. I started off with Python, creating small projects and getting a feel for the language.

One night, an ad for a development job popped up on my Instagram. Despite feeling underqualified due to my limited experience, I decided to apply. To my surprise, they called back. During the interview, I was honest about my novice status in the field.

Impressively, they decided to take a chance on me. This opportunity expanded my horizons beyond Python, introducing me to C#, JavaScript, and TypeScript. Working in this role has been an enlightening journey. Every day presents a chance to learn something new and to continue developing my skills.

I've come a long way since those first days of dabbling in Python, but there's still so much more to explore. Have a look through my repositories to see my progress and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project.
